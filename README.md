Car-Segmentation: Segmentation of various outer components of car like body, windows, lights and wheels using Unet architecture.

Dataset: Colllected the dataset from kaggle and it contains 5 classes. You use this url to download the data https://www.kaggle.com/intelecai/car-segmentation.

Model Architecture: Used Unet architecture for feature extraction. Used various layers for downsampling and uppersampling and used dice coefficient as an activation functions, loss functions and trained the model with 25 epouchs.

Results: Achieved dice coefficient of 96%.
Future work: Fine-tune the model to improve the model performance.
